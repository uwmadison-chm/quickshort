# quickshort
A very(!) small Flask-based URL shortener. Biased towards making small-ish numbers of forgiving-to-type URLs.

Strongly normalizes incoming requests. Passes URL parameters on to the destination. Stores redirects and hit counts in the filesystem â€” does not rely on a SQL database.

The idea here: For incoming requests:
# Separate the request path and query.
# Put the query in its own dictionary
# Normalize the path by downcasing and stripping all non-alphanumeric characters
# Look in `rewrites` for a file matching the normalized path
# Read that file. The first line is the redirect path. The second line is the hit count.
# Increment hit count, write the file.
# Merge query params with the redirect path's redirect params (redirect's params win every time), generate destination URL
# Send a 301
